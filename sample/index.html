	SKYWALLET MODAL Version 0.
	This code will place a Pay with Cloudcoin button on your page.When you click this 
	button, a modal will popup. The cusomter will enter their payment info. 
	Then the modal will transfer funds from their account to yours. Then the customer
	will be redirected to a URL like this:
	https://yourdomain.com/your_action_page.php?amount=100&senders_skywallet=jd.skywalletcc&
	guid=4aba6d7e9df04e7395bb4c941a594b70&your_parameter_1=something&your_parameter-2=something
	
	
	INSTRUCTION STEPS:
	1. Customize the POSJS constructor. 
		Please set the four fields to your needs. 
		
		Timeout: The number of microsecond that your web page will wait as it 
			attempts to transfer cloudcoins from the sender to the receiver. 
			If your users have slow Internet, this should be increased. 
			Usually, five seconds if fine. 
			
		action: The url that the GET variables will be sent to. 
		
		merchant_skywallet: Your skywallet that you want to receive the senders funds in. 
	
	2. When the user adds something to their basket or there basket changes, call the 
		setAmountDue() function. An alternative would be to add a line within the 
		"openModal()" function so that the total due is set.
		
	3. Add any fields that you want to have sent to your action page. You must put an 
		action page on your server. You can add GET parameters by just adding fields to 
		the get_parameters object and giving that field a value. 
		Like this: get_parameter.firstName = "Bob";
	
	4. Put any tests that you want done in the "openModal()" function. Here, you could also
		call the setAmountDue() and setMerchantVaribles()0. 
	
	
	5. After the user enters data into the Modal and clicks Pay, they will be redirected
		to your action page along with all the GET variables. That page will then
		check with the RAIDA to ensure that you have received the sender's funds. 
		See our sample php page for help with this.
